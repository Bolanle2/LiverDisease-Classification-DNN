Deep Learning Classification of Liver Disease Stages Using RNA-Seq Data
Overview

This project explores the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify different stages of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) based on gene expression profiles. Using RNA-Seq data (GSE260666) and focusing on short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) signaling pathways, the goal was to identify expression patterns associated with disease progression.

The analysis combines traditional bioinformatics preprocessing with deep learning classification, providing insights into the potential of transcriptomic signatures for liver disease staging.
